# sample-diffusion

ðŸš§ This project is early in development. Expect breaking changes! ðŸš§

This repository contains the python project that runs inference tasks for the [Sample Diffusion web application](https://github.com/sudosilico/sample-diffusion-app). It is used to generate audio samples using Harmonai [Dance Diffusion](https://github.com/Harmonai-org/sample-generator) models.

## Features

- A CLI for generating audio samples from the command line using Dance Diffusion models. (`cli.py`)
- A script for reducing the file size of Dance Diffusion models by removing data that is only needed for training and not inference. (`scripts/trim_model.py`)

## Installation

### Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (to clone the repo)
- [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) (to set up the python environment)

`conda` can be installed through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). To run on an Apple Silicon device, you will need to use a conda installation that includes Apple Silicon support, such as [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

### Cloning the repo

Clone the repo and `cd` into it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sudosilico/sample-diffusion
cd sample-diffusion
```

### Setting up the conda environment

Create the `conda` environment:

```sh
# If you're not running on an Apple Silicon machine:
conda env create -f environment.yml

# For Apple Silicon machines:
conda env create -f environment-mac.yml
```

This may take a few minutes as it will install all the necessary Python dependencies so that they will be available to the CLI script.

> Note: You must activate the `dd` conda environment after creating it. You can do this by running `conda activate dd` in the terminal. You will need to do this every time you open a new terminal window. Learn more about [conda environments.](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html)

```sh
conda activate dd
```

## Using the `cli.py` CLI

### Generating samples

Make a `models` folder and place your model in `models/dd/model.ckpt`, then run the generator:

```sh
python cli.py
```

Alternatively, you can pass a custom model path as an argument instead of using the `models/dd/model.ckpt` default path:

```sh
python cli.py --ckpt models/some-other-model.ckpt
```

Your audio samples will then be in one of the following folders:

- `audio/Output/DD/{mode}/{seed}_{steps}`

### Using multiple batches

If you get an out-of-VRAM error, you may want to process in multiple batches.

Both of these commands will generate 25 audio samples in total, but the second one is split into multiple batches, allowing for a lower maximum VRAM usage.

```sh
# Generate 25 files, in 1 batch of 25 samples
python cli.py --batch_size 25
```

## Using the model trimming script

`scripts/trim_model.py` can be used to reduce the file size of Dance Diffusion models by removing data that is only needed for training and not inference. For our first models, this reduced the model size by about 75% (from 3.46 GB to 0.87 GB).

To use it, simply pass the path to the model you want to trim as an argument:

```sh
python scripts/trim_model.py models/model.ckpt
```

This will create a new model file at `models/model_trim.ckpt`.
